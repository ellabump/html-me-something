        <li>Parque Nacional de Patagonia</li>
            <p>My gaze after college was drawn south, to jagged peaks and glacial winds.  I wanted
                to explore a territory that was wild, untamed. I did a volunteer program in Patagonia, 
                tearing down fences from old estancias and removing invasive species.I spent three weeks in the 
                field. <a href="http://www.conservacionpatagonica.org/home.htm#modal">This is the website for the Conservacion Patagonica.</a>

        <li>Glaciers</li>
            <p>
                I had plan to go work for a rafting company across the border of Argentina, in Mendoza
                but after glimpsing the mountains around me I couldn't stop imagining the far south where
                the coastline split in fjords, and the horned mountains of Torres del Paine skimmed the 
                clouds. I went south.

        <li>The Lemon Farm, Santiago</li>
            <p>
                I returned to the city of Santiago, which houses forty percent of Chile's population.  From 
                there, I worked at a lemon farm, a permaculture farm, and traveled to the Futaleufu with my amazing
                friend Lydia Bleifuss.
