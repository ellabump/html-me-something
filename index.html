        <li>Parque Nacional de Patagonia</li>
            <p>My gaze after college was drawn south, to jagged peaks and glacial winds.  I wanted
                to explore a territory that was wild, untamed.  I thought I'd try 
                for Patagonia. I got into a volunteer program filled with physical labor;
            we'd be tearing down fences from old estancias and removing invasive species. Conservationists
            Kris and Doug Thompkins had privately bought land and were turning it into a park, saving
            an ecosystem that was not well protected by the Chilean government. I spent three weeks in the 
            field.

                I had plan to go work for a rafting company across the border of Argentina, in Mendoza
                but after glimpsing the mountains around me I couldn't stop imagining the far south where
                the coastline split in fjords, and the horned mountains of Torres del Paine skimmed the 
                clouds. I went south.

                I returned to the city of Santiago, which houses forty percent of Chile's population.  From 
                there, I work at a lemon farm, a permaculture farm, and travel to the Futaleufu with my amazing
                friend Lydia Bleifuss.
