        <li>Parque Nacional de Patagonia</li>
            <p>The far south of Chile holds jagged peaks and glacial winds.  I wanted
                to explore a territory that was wild, untamed. In November 2015, the start of the southern 
                hemisphere's summer, I volunteered in Patagonia at a national park in construction, 
                tearing down fences from old estancias and removing invasive species.

        <li>Glaciers</li>
            <p>
                I had planned to go work for a rafting company across the border of Argentina, in Mendoza
                but after glimpsing the mountains around me I couldn't resist the far south where
                the coastline split in fjords, and the most famous mountains reigned.

        <li>The Lemon Farm, Santiago</li>
            <p>
                I returned to the city of Santiago in January, which houses forty percent of Chile's population.  From 
                there, I worked at a lemon farm, a permaculture farm, and traveled to the Futaleufu with my amazing
                friend Lydia Bleifuss.
